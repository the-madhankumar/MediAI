## ⚙️ Functional Requirements

### 1️⃣ Document Upload and Extraction

* Users can upload medical reports in **PDF or image format**.
* System extracts **text and tabular data** using OCR and NLP.
* Extracted data includes test names, values, and ranges.
* Insights are generated using **Python (pandas / SQL agent)** logic.

### 2️⃣ Automated Insights

* AI evaluates extracted data and generates health summaries.
* Detects abnormalities (e.g., high cholesterol, low vitamin D).
* Provides recommendations like “Consult physician” or “Maintain hydration.”
* Displays visual charts for health trends (e.g., sugar level vs normal range).

### 3️⃣ Symptom-Based Diagnosis

* User inputs symptoms (e.g., “fever, fatigue, headache”).
* AI predicts possible conditions using pre-trained medical datasets.
* Provides confidence scores and suggestions for next steps.

### 4️⃣ Health History Dashboard

* Shows historical trends from previous reports.
* Allows comparison between current and past results.
* Option to download combined insights as PDF.

### 5️⃣ User Authentication

* Google / Email sign-in.
* User profiles to store reports and insights history.

### 6️⃣ Chat Assistant (Built-in AI)

* Users can ask questions like:
  *“What does my WBC count mean?”*
  *“Is my blood sugar okay?”*
* The chat uses **LLM-based reasoning** but remains **custom-trained** with medical context (not ChatGPT directly).

## 🧩 Data Flow Example (User Journey)

### Example Scenario:

1. **User:** Aarav uploads a PDF “Blood_Report.pdf”.
2. **System:** Extracts test data (e.g., Hemoglobin, WBC, Glucose).
3. **AI Engine:** Detects “LDL slightly high” → flags mild cholesterol risk.
4. **User enters symptom:** “Headache, tiredness, sweating.”
5. **AI Diagnoser:** Suggests *“Possible early signs of hypertension.”*
6. **Dashboard:** Shows progress chart of cholesterol levels over time.
7. **User exports insights** → “Personal_Health_Summary.pdf”.
